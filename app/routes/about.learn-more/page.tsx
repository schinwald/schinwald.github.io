													<h3>Life</h3>
													<OriginIcon className="w-5 h-5 text-green-600" />
												</div>
												<p>
													I was born in the early summer of 1995 in Rhinebeck,
													New York, alongside my twin brother. My earliest years
													were spent in Red Hook, NY, before our family embarked
													on a unique adventure, living in Honduras and
													Nicaragua for a year and then moving to Buenos Aires,
													Argentina, for four years. My dad’s work at Tiempos
													del Mundo, an international newspaper, brought us to
													South America, where I had my first exposure to a
													different culture and language. I quickly picked up
													Spanish and embraced the local love of soccer.
													Watching Lionel Messi dominate headlines and pitches
													inspired me to play soccer as much as I could.
												</p>
												<p>
													When we returned to Canada, we settled in Guelph,
													Ontario, where I’ve lived ever since. Thanks to
													speaking English at home and my mom’s French Canadian
													heritage, the transition felt natural. School life was
													a blend of creativity and independence for me. I spent
													hours practicing ping pong against a flipped-up table
													or shooting hoops at our basketball net, often playing
													by myself. Video games became another outlet, though
													sharing one computer with my two brothers led to
													plenty of fights over whose turn it was—especially
													during World of Warcraft raids. I also had a strong
													passion for art and once dreamed of becoming an
													animator, filling sketchbooks with drawings as I
													imagined a creative future.
												</p>
												<p>
													High school introduced me to programming through basic
													classes in web development and Java, but these
													experiences didn’t immediately spark a career
													interest. Despite my curiosity about technology, I
													didn’t find much encouragement from my teachers to
													pursue programming as a viable path.
												</p>
												<p>
													After graduating, I took time off to explore my
													options, working a variety of odd jobs—including
													serving at a banquet hall, inspecting automotive
													parts, and assembling hoses in a factory. These
													experiences, while challenging, reinforced my
													determination to find a career I was passionate about.
												</p>
												<p>
													Eventually, I committed to software engineering,
													driven by my love for programming and the desire to
													understand the technology I use daily. I enrolled in a
													computer science program and quickly discovered my
													passion for web development, scalable applications,
													and even game development. I’m also deeply interested
													in creating streamlined development environments that
													enhance productivity and creativity.
												</p>
												<p>
													Looking back, the journey—from my global upbringing to
													odd jobs and self-discovery—has shaped who I am today.
													I’m grateful for the experiences that brought me to a
													career I truly love.
