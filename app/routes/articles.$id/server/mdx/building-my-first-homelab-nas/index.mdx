### Purpose

Originally, all I wanted was a NAS to be able to store photos and videos for my entire family, but it quickly evolved into something out of hand. I saw opportunities to ditch paid streaming service and build my own home media server, create automations catered directly to my lifestyle, and an environment for me to tinker with technologies outside of my regular development setup. The world was my oyster.

I did a lot of research for this build (some might say too much). Being risk adverse, I didn't want to make any mistakes along the way. Finding people who had already paved the way and made similar builds, made the process more comforting, but there were still some unknowns.

### Specifications
- JONSBO N3 Black Case
- WD Red Pro 20TB (x2)
- ASRock Rack X570D4I-2T Motherboard
  - Noctua NM-i115x Mounting-Kit
  - Noctua NH-U12S CPU Cooler
- AMD Ryzen 7 5700G CPU
- Corsair SF1000 PSU

### Case



### Harddrives

I thought choosing a harddrive would be simple. I had two objectives with my build, one was to store archival data for my family and another was to have more volatile data where I didn't care about if it go corrupted or not. I had found out there were two types of HDDs, some were cheap and some were expensive. Turns out the expensive ones were expensive because they were specifically designed for NAS builds.

When you run multiple HDDs next to each other, they create a lot of __ which can cause corrupted data. Okay so I'll buy expensive for the archival data and cheap for the volatile data -- WRONG! I can't do that because the cheap HDDs might interfere with the expensive ones. I had no choice but to go with expensive ones throughout the build. I decided on the WD Red Pro, because it seemed like the best bang for buck. A good middleground.

### Motherboard

Deciding on a motherboard was also a difficult task. I wanted a motherboard that would be future proof. I wanted 8 SATA, RJ45 (10GbE), and 4 DIMM slots with ECC support. There ended up being limited options and I landed on the ASRock Rack X570D4I-2T.

It was available on newegg as a quote order, so I requested the quote and ended up getting ghosted the the representative for like a month. Everything decision was riding on this motherboard so it really shifted the timeline for me getting this all built.

### CPU

This part was pretty straight forward. The motherboard restricted me to AMD Ryzen 5000 series and the AMD Ryzen 7 5700G was a great price and had integrated graphics and 8 cores for parallel processing.

### Power Supply

This was also pretty straight forward. I wanted a PSU that would be able to fit in the case, have good efficiency, and be able to support more power for when I decided to add a GPU.

### RAM

### NVMe SSDs
